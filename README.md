# KNN_image-classification

In this project a pretrained VGG16 model is first used to extract the features from its last layer and then PCA is performed on the feature vectors to increase efficiency as similar features accross the different classes of dataset would be removed . KNN is then performed for the classification task and it is observed to have an Classification Accuracy of 100% on the test dataset as the images of different classes were quite different .
